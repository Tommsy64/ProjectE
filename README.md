ProjectE [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Tommsy64/ProjectE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Tommsy64/ProjectE)
=============

ProjectE is a complete rewrite of Equivlent Exchange 2 (EE2) for Minecraft 1.7.10 and up.

The versions found under [releases](https://github.com/Tommsy64/ProjectE/releases) are the same as the original ProjectE with the exception of the unlocalized names. They have been changed back to the old ones prior to 0.2d-dev10.
If you used any ProjectE older than 0.2d-dev10 and would like to update without losing any of your blocks/items, use these builds.
